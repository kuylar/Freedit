# Freedit

## ~~An open source third party reddit client that doesn't use their paid API~~

> After implementing the bare minimum, I've lost complete interest in this project, and Reddit as a whole. I'm leaving the current code that contains the authentication logic, so someone else can come and finish the work. This repository doesn't have a license, and I do not care about the code in it, you can use it however you would like, but some credit would be appreciated.
